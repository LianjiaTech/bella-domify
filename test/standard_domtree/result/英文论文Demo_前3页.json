Distinct from the conventional human-labeled datasets, our approach obtains high quality annotations in a simple yet effective way with weak supervision. Inspired by existing document layout annotations (Siegel et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019; Zhong et al., 2019), there are a great number of digital-born documents such as the PDFs of research pa-pers that are compiled by LATEX using their source code. The LATEX system contains the explicit semantic structure information using mark-up tags as the building blocks, such as abstract, author, caption, equa-tion, figure, footer, list, paragraph, reference, section, table and title. To distinguish individual semantic structures, we manipulate the source code to specify different colors to the text of different semantic units. In this way, different text zones can be clearly segmented and identified as separate logical roles, which is shown in Figure 1. The advantage of DocBank is that, it can be used in any sequence labeling models from the NLP perspective. Meanwhile, DocBank can also be easily converted into image-based annotations to support object detection models in computer vision. In this way, models from different modalities can be compared fairly using DocBank, and multi-modal approaches will be further investi-gated and boost the performance of document layout analysis. To verify the effectiveness of DocBank, we conduct experiments using four baseline models: 1) BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), a pre-trained model using only textual information based on the Transformer architecture. 2) RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), a robustly optimized method for pre-training the Transformer architecture. 3) LayoutLM (Xu et al., 2019), a multi-modal architecture that integrates both the text information and layout information. 4) Faster R-CNN (Ren et al., 2015), a high performance object detection networks depending on region proposal algorithms to hypothesize object locations. The experiment results show that the LayoutLM model sig-nificantly outperforms the BERT and RoBERTa models and the object detection model on DocBank for document layout analysis.
