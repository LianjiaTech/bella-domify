It is a challenging problem due to the varying layouts and formats of the documents. Existing techniques have been proposed based on conventional rule-based or machine learn-ing methods, where most of them fail to generalize well because they rely on hand crafted features that may be not robust to layout variations. Recently, the rapid development of deep learning in computer vision has significantly boosted the data-driven image-based approaches for document layout analysis. Although these approaches have been widely adopted and made significant progress, they usually lever-age visual features while neglecting textual features from the documents. Therefore, it is inevitable to explore how to leverage the visual and textual information in a unified way for document layout analysis.",

However, pre-trained models not only require large-scale unlabeled data for self-supervised learning, but also need high quality labeled data for task-specific fine-tuning to achieve good performance. For document layout analysis tasks, there have been some image-based document layout datasets, while most of them are built for computer vision approaches and they are difficult to apply to NLP methods. In addition, image-based datasets mainly include the page images and the bounding boxes of large semantic structures, which are not fine-grained token-level annotations. Moreover, it is also time-consuming and labor-intensive to produce human-labeled and fine-grained token-level text block arrangement. Therefore, it is vital to leverage weak",

Distinct from the conventional human-labeled datasets, our approach obtains high quality annotations in a simple yet effective way with weak supervision. Inspired by existing document layout annotations (Siegel et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019; Zhong et al., 2019), there are a great number of digital-born documents such as the PDFs of research pa-pers that are compiled by LATEX using their source code. The LATEX system contains the explicit semantic structure information using mark-up tags as the building blocks, such as abstract, author, caption, equation, figure, footer, list, paragraph, reference, section, table and title. To distinguish individual semantic structures, we manipulate the source code to specify different colors to the text of different semantic units. In this way, different text zones can be clearly segmented and identified as separate logical roles, which is shown in Figure 1. The advantage of DocBank is that, it can be used in any sequence labeling models from the NLP perspective. Meanwhile, DocBank can also be easily converted into image-based annotations to support object detection models in computer vision. In this way, models from different modalities can be compared fairly using DocBank, and multi-modal approaches will be further investigated and boost the performance of document layout analysis. To verify the effectiveness of DocBank, we conduct experiments using four baseline models: 1) BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), a pre-trained model using only textual information based on the Transformer architecture. 2) RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), a robustly optimized method for pre-training the Transformer architecture. 3) LayoutLM (Xu et al., 2019), a multi-modal architecture that integrates both the text information and layout information. 4) Faster R-CNN (Ren et al., 2015), a high performance object detection networks depending on region proposal algorithms to hypothesize object locations. The experiment results show that the LayoutLM model significantly outperforms the BERT and RoBERTa models and the object detection model on DocBank for document layout analysis. We hope DocBank will empower more document layout analysis models, meanwhile promoting more customized network structures to make substantial advances in this area.",

In this work, the following semantic structures are annotated in DocBank: {Abstract, Author, Caption, Equation, Figure, Footer, List, Paragraph, Reference, Section, Table and Title}. In TableBank, the tables are labeled with the help of the ‘fcolorbox’ command. However, for DocBank, the target structures are mainly composed of text, where the ‘fcolorbox’ cannot be well applied. Therefore, we use the ‘color’ command to distinguish these semantic structures by changing their font colors into structure-specific colors. Basically, there are two types of commands to represent semantic structures. Some of the LATEX commands are simple words preceded by a backslash. For instance, the section titles in LATEX documents are usually in the format as follows:",
